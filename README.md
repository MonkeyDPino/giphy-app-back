# Giphy Pino

This is the backend repository using express in nodejs to provide service for the [react app](https://giphy-pino.vercel.app) which repo is [here](https://github.com/MonkeyDPino/giphy-app).

### Reason

This is just an app to practice react skills, i used vercel to host it [here](https://giphy-pino.vercel.app), and the backend is hosted in heroku using MongoDB Atlas as database.
